# Abstract
In Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) research, anomaly detection detecting abnormal behavior and diagnosis identifying the underlying root cause—are often treated as distinct, isolated tasks. However, diagnosis algorithms require symptoms, i.e. temporally and spatially isolated anomalies, as input. Thus, anomaly detection and diagnosis must be developed together to provide a holistic solution for diagnosis in CPS. We therefore propose a method for utilizing deep learning-based anomaly
detection to generate inputs for Consistency-Based Diagnosis (CBD). We evaluate our approach on a simulated and a real-world CPS dataset, where our model demonstrates strong performance relative to other state-of-the-art models.
