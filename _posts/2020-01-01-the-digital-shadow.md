# Abstract
The optimization of production systems is a core-business for manufacturing companies. Modern approaches focus on strategic optimization via the concept of the Digital Twin. In this paper we present a model for the operational optimization of manufacturing systems via the core technology
of the Digital Shadow. The model combines three main-aspects: automation, universality and the utilization of real-time data. Automation is achieved by a self-developed algorithm, universality by the application of a genetic algorithm and the integration of real-time-data through the utilization of the Digital Shadow. We validate the model by means of experimental-design.
