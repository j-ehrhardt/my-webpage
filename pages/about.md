Hi Iâ€™m Jonas!
I am a PhD student in Artificial Intelligence for Cyber-Physical Systems at the Helmut-Schmidt University in Hamburg, Germany. 
I am working at the chair of Computer Science in Mechanical Engineering, at the department of Mechanical Engineering. 

My research focuses on messy planning problems that arise in the context of Cyber-Physical Systems. 
I am working on sub-symbolic algorithms that tackle such messy planning problems based on system observations, rather than system descriptions. 

Apart from that, I am interested in Cognitive Science and Neuroscience.
I love to draw inspiration from these domains for algorithmic solutions, encouraging a interdisciplinary view on real-life problems from those perspecitves. 

Below, you can find some information on my education, experience and recent activity in the scientific community.
